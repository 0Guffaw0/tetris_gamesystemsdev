## Design Rationale

#### Why the P-Piece?

First, here’s some fun facts about the piece:
- Fits in the letter naming convention of the other pieces!
- Other names include: “Thumb-Down Piece”, “T-Piece Carrying a Box Piece”, and “Fiddlehead Piece”!
- Could be described as “Perfect”...

Kidding aside, here’s a brief description of the piece: The P-Piece is made up of five cells, with four cells in a square formation and a single cell connected to the lower left cell in said formation (this can be considered the “upright” position of the piece. If you’re a huge Tetris nerd this is the Point right/Flat left position). 

The piece isn’t meant to be that wacky of a shape, as it’s meant to fit into the game very naturally! Considering that it’s basically the O-Piece with “a little extra on the end”, it’s a nice way to ease in the concept of pentominoes to the player.

#### Custom Gameplay Experience

Instructions:
- WASD to move pieces.
- E/Q to turn pieces.
- Use Shift to swap pieces. 
-  to hard drop pieces.

I really wanted to do a custom board set up, similar to the “big bang” style levels you see in the Puyo Puyo Tetris series - however, I ran out of time and I am what some might call a “coding dunce”. As in, I have difficulties understanding the core fundamentals for creating code. It’s not an excuse, it’s just my current reality!

I instead tried to create a more relaxing version of Tetris - which I have been calling “Long Tetris”. I realized that by extending the board, it takes longer to make complete stacks, which forces the player to slow down. The player can take the time to build elaborate structures at their own pace!
